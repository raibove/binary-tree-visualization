# binary-tree-visualization

This is a simple React app that allows you to input an array representation of a binary tree, and visualize it as a tree diagram. The app also allows you to click on a node in the tree, and highlights all the nodes on the path from the clicked node to the root.

## Getting Started
To get started with this app, first clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/raibove/binary-tree-visualization.git
```

Then, navigate into the project directory:
```
cd binary-tree-visualization
```

Next, install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Finally, start the app:
```
npm start
```

This should start a development server at http://127.0.0.1:5173/, where you can interact with the app.

## Usage
To use the app, simply enter an array representation of your binary tree into the input box, and click "Submit". The app will then render a tree diagram of the binary tree.

If you click on a node in the tree diagram, the app will highlight all the nodes on the path from the clicked node to the root.
